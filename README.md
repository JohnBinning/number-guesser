## Synopsis


On this site, users can guess a random number.  The number starts out between 1-100, and upon guess input,
the user is told if their guess is high, low, or correct.  Upon a correct guess, the user is prompted to play again, this time
with the minimum and maximum values increased by 10 each.  The user also has the option to set a custom range.

## Motivation

I wanted to create a game where users could guess a random number, and I wanted users to be able to specify a custom range.
